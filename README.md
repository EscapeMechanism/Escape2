# Droplet

### Play
Droplet is a simple physics platformer - use the A & D keys to spin, move through the levels to the exit.

### Editor
* Create a new level by entering a name in the main view and hitting 'create'.
* Select a block type near the bottom and tap 'a' to add a block to the view (it's added wherever the mouse currently is.)
* Drag the blocks around (and drag the camera view around) with the left mouse button - zoom out with the scroll wheel.
* Activate 'delete' mode by clicking the trashcan icon - click the blocks you want to remove. (Don't forget to deactivate it.)
* Click the 'save' icon to save changes - press the 'play' button to test out your saved level.
* The main page shows the folder where levels are saved - share them with your friends. :)
